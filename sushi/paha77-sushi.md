# Sushi

## Ingredients

(Note: the amounts used in the vinegar mixture may vary depending on the individual sushi shops.)

+- Uncooked rice 3000g
+- Water 3000cc
+- Rice vinegar 360cc
+- Sugar 160 g
+- Salt 100 g

## Directions

+- Wash the rice thoroughly but don't wash it so forcefully that the rice grains crack. Do not wash the rice in hot water and never use soap. Next, rinse the rice with water. Repeat the process about 3 times.
+- Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes to one hour before cooking.
+- Cook the rice. While the rice is cooking, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl.
+- When the rice is done, let it stand for about 15 minutes.
+- Place the rice in the handai and slowly pour the vinegar mixture over the rice. Use the shamoji in a slicing motion to thoroughly blend the rice and vinegar mixture. Be careful not to press the rice with the shamoji. While mixing it, fan the rice with the uchiwa to remove any excess moisture.
+- Keep the Shari in a covered container maintaining its temperature around body temperature.
